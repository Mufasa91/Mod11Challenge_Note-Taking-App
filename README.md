# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description

In this challenge, I need to create a back-end for a note-taking application called Note Taker. The back-end will be built using Express.js, a framework for creating web applications in Node.js. The application will allow users to write and save notes, and the note data will be stored in a JSON file.

The front-end of the application has already been developed, so my task is to create the server-side code that will handle the storage and retrieval of note data. Once the back-end is built and connected to the front-end, the final step is to deploy the completed application to Heroku, a platform for hosting web applications.

### User Story

AS A small business owner  
I WANT to be able to write and save notes  
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete  

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a note-taking application  
WHEN I open the Note Taker  
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page  
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page  
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column  
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text  
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page  
WHEN I click on the Save icon  
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes  
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column  
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column  
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page  
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
